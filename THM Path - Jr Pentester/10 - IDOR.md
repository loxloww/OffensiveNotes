IDOR = insecure direct object reference
-> access control vulnerability

ex :
in url -> .../id=1293
try to change the id

most time the id is encoded
most popular encoded type is base64

some time they are hashed
if it's md5 -> can try to cracked it

Test for IDOR :

Unpredictable IDs

excellent method of IDOR detection is to create two accounts and swap the Id numbers between them.
-> If you can view the other users' content using their Id number while still being logged in with a different account (or not logged in at all), you've found a valid IDOR vulnerability.
